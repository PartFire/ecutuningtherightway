# Welcome

There's a lot of outdated information on the Web that leads ECU Tuners astray,
propagating bad practices. _ECU Tuning: The Right Way_ is an easy-to-read,
quick reference for ECU Tuning standards, links to authoritative tutorials
around the Web and what the contributors consider to be best practices at the present
time.

_There is no canonical way to use Tune ECUs_. This website aims to introduce new ECU Chip Tuners
to some topics which they may not discover until it is too late, and aims
to give seasoned pros some fresh ideas on those topics they've been doing for years
without ever reconsidering. This website will also not tell you which tools to use, but
instead offer suggestions for multiple options, when possible explaining the differences
in approach and use-case.

This is a living document and will continue to be updated with more helpful information
and examples as they become available.
