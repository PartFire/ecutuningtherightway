## OBD Tuning {#obd_tuning}

When you arrive at the vehicle here are some pointers or consider it a general guide to calibrating the ecu correctly and safely through the OBD. Do not try to cut corners, rush or cheat the job! Remember to choose the right tool for the specific vehicle in hand.

### Basic OBD Procedure {#basic_obd_procedure}
1: Visual Inspection
Check for fluid or air leaks. Check that everything is in its place? Once again its all about covering yourself should something arise during or after the tune due to poor maintenance. Check the fluid levels, you do not want to be tuning the car if there is no oil or water in it! If you spot anything make the customer aware that you see a problem, that way you are covered. Check the obd port is in good condition also look to make sure it is the original plug as some people fit tuning boxes which connect via the obd and can be disguised very well. Check to see if it has a tuning box fitted in the engine bay.

2: Test Drive the vehicle
Check for any warning light's on the dash. Listen out for any peculiar noise's coming from the engine ie boost leaks, knocking, rattles....etc or anything you may think is not right. Make sure there is no lack of power or intermittent running issue's

3: Diagnostic Check
Do not skip this step if you want to carry out the job professionally and successfully. We have made the calibration file server quick and easy for you to use so there is no excuse for not checking the vehicle correctly! If there is something wrong with the vehicle then it will be down to you to decide whether to proceed to the next step. Clear any faults in the Ecu this means all of the control modules to ensure all gateways are clear for a nice clean and successful read.

4: Reading the vehicle
You must ensure that it has a power supply (charger) plugged onto the battery. The recommended voltage for programming an ecu is atleast 12.5v but not exceeding 14.5v. If you do not care for providing a power supply to the car then it can result in the ecu failing (malfunctioning). Plug your tuning tool into the obd port and ensure it is fully inserted. Make sure your computer has ample charge or it is plugged into a power supply incase the read time exceed's the life of the pc's battery Close any other programs running in the background. Rest the pc in a comfortable place in the vehicle where by the data cable's cannot be disturbed during the programmation. Ensure the ignition is at the 2nd stage. If you need help with advice on how to enable the ignition ie bmw or renault cars please see our specific guide for these vehicles. Make sure the drivers window is down incase it has anti hi-jack, you do not want it to lock itself during the procedure. Turn off any functions that maybe running in the vehicle ie stereo, fans, etc....

ID the vehicle Ensure you have the correct protocol as an example the fg galletto can sometimes id the vehicle but may not necessarily be the correct protocol so if this happens and the vehicle does not want to read then try a different protocol. Once the vehicle has read the Ecu successfully disconnect the battery charger and pull out the ignition key.

5: Upload your file to the server and retrieve your PCW calibration file

6: Writing the mod calibration file into the Ecu
If you have removed your pc from the vehicle ensure the obd data cable is fully inserted into the port. Re-connect the battery charger. Insert the ignition key. Make sure the battery (power supply) is atleast 12.5v but not exceeding 14.5v Ensure the ignition is at the 2nd stage. ID the vehicle to re-initialise the Ecu Once you are happy, select the mod file and write it into the Ecu. Be-careful not to disturb the pc or the vehicle during the programmation. When it has finished programming remove the ignition key and disconnect the battery charger.

7: Test Drive the vehicle
With the customer present test drive the vehicle to check it and also show them the power gains

8: Diagnostic Check
Diagnostically check the vehicle to make sure all is ok.

Job Done.

Another Happy Customer!
