## Master / Slave Flash Tools {#master_slave_tools}

What many people who are not involved in chip tuning do not realise is that there is distinct difference between slave and master tools. The long and the short of it is, Slave tools are always part of a network, and that they are tied/locked to a master tool/device. The Slave tool therefore is as its name suggests. Both tools work very similar to each other, as in the procedure is identical, but the outcome is very different. 

SLAVE TOOL CONS: notice we say CONS as there is no pros to using a slave device.

Can only produce encrypted/compressed files dumps, that can only be opened/edited by its master

You are locked to a single file supplier

Can only flash/write files incoming from its master. What this means is, if the vehicle ever needs to be put back to stock for example, then the slave  must first read the modified file and then ask its master for an original file to flash back. You cannot re use the original file that was read!!

You can only accept facts from your master, if there is a problem with a tune, then you can only take your masters word for it

Some BDM tools on a slave format will only let you read a full back up of the ecu, where as a master device will let you read/write the ecu in separate segments, ie FULL BACK UP, MPC, EXT FLASH, EEPROM

Slave tools are the cheapest way to get into chip tuning legitimately, As a result of this, and the very open accessibility to the tools, many un-trained and un-experienced people are buying in. This is now a major problem in the chip tuning industry for a number of reasons.  

MASTER TOOLS

Fully open files for anyone to open/edit with a suitable editor

You are free to use any number of file suppliers around the globe

You can store the original read from the vehicle and write it back at any time should a problem arise

You can have your tuning files checked by a 3rd party if you are not happy. You dont just have to take your suppliers word for it.

Full access to all areas of an ECU when in BDM mode 

Master tools are the most expensive tools but this is an asset to your company for the reasons stated above. Slave tools are worthless and hold no value whatsoever.

When using a chiptuner, always use master tool owners. You can be sure that they are experienced, hold knowledge and have an invested interest in what they are doing.
