# ECU Tuning {#ecu_tuning_title}

Here's where we are going to cover the most common ways to tune an ecu. Whether it be by the OBD port or by removing the ECU from the vehicle and flashing it on the bench, we will cover the different processes including how to open an ECU, different ways to flash an ECU and most importantly, How to recover an ECU should things go sideways.

Remember this a live document, and it will be constantly updated. For the now, we will group the ECU's into families as they will be gentically similar and will utilise the same flashing techniques.
