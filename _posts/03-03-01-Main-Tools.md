## Equipment {#equipment}
We will cover the most common and readily available tools here. we will break the tools down into an OBD or Bench Flash catagory although some tools on the market actually cover both and are a combined all in one tool, so these will appear in both sections.

### OBD Tools {#OBD_Tools}
These tools are for flashing data over the vehicles diagnostic port. Included is a general overview, key features, a picture of the genuine tool for reference. 
If you are starting up a business in the Chip Tuning industry we strongly recommend you buy Genuine Professional Tuning Tool's. We would advise against buying a cloned or knock off tools. We must remind you that the cost of a new Ecu can be £500 - £2000 so make sure you have all the necessary tool's for the job. All OBD flash tool's have their strong and weak point's so be sure that you are using the correct tool for that specific vehicle

There are 4 main tool manufacturers are-

*ALIENTECH KESS V2

*FLASHTEC CMD

*FGTECH EOBD2

*AMT-cartech MPPS


### Bench Tools {#bench_tools}
These tools are for flashing ECUs off the vehicle, as the name suggests on the bench. These tools are required for a number reasons, but also are being used less now that newer OBD methods are being developed. This method of Flashing lets the user read the entire data block from the requested area, this is what would be called a full/bdm read. Its an access all areas scenario. Even though OBD tooling is getting more advanced there are still a number of ECU's that cannot be flashed OBD therefore require an unlock procedure on the bench. Bench tools also excel at recovering ecu's from bad flashes etc, cloning ecus, editing stored eeprom data and so on. 

The main player in the bench tool area would be Alientechs KTAG tool. This would be purely because of its ease of use and its in-tool help data is very useful. It can unlock/Flash most ecu's now with its latest updates, although somewhat late compared to flastecs CMD bootloader protocols. If its the very latest protocols you want, and you want them first then the CMD OBD with Bootloader enabled would be the way to go.
