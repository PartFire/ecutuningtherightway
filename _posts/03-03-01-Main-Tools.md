## Flash Tools {#flash_tools}
We will cover the most common and readily available tools here. we will break the tools down into an OBD or Bench Flash catagory although some tools on the market actually cover both and are a combined all in one tool, so these will appear in both sections.

### OBD Tools {#OBD_Tools}
These tools are for flashing data over the vehicles diagnostic port. Included is a general overview, key features, a picture of the genuine tool for reference. 
If you are starting up a business in the Chip Tuning industry we strongly recommend you buy Genuine Professional Tuning Tool's. We would advise against buying a cloned or knock off tools. We must remind you that the cost of a new Ecu can be £500 - £2000 so make sure you have all the necessary tool's for the job.
